# **Adithyan's Solution to Shamir's Secret Sharing Problem**

Please do go through my hand written dry run of the code in the bottom 
## **Overview**
This repository contains my solution to **Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm**.

---

## **Solution Approach**


**Formula used:**
Lagrange Polynomial Interpolation


###Solution in C++**
I know the easiest way to parse the json file was using java but couldnt spend more time on connect java with my c++ code which I am more familiar with. So, I used a pre built library to parse json file.
